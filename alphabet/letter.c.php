$lang['DESCRIPTION'] = 'Rich men don’t want to die. The biggest problem that needs ‘disrupting’ is death and Calico is the Alphabet company that’s working on it. They no doubt picture utopian visions of a world where disease is eradicated. I see the consciousnesses of the uber-rich preserved in digital amber as AI, like Wintermute in William Gibson’s ‘Neuromancer.’';
$lang['EXTENDED'] = 'Calico’s name is shorthand for the California Life Company. Does that honestly not stink of Orwellian ‘Newspeak’ to you? An uneasy feeling in my stomach tells me Calico could be Larry Page’s Ozymandias moment:';
